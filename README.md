### Verifying Installation

To verify the installation, run a simple script to import the package:

```python
from sage_bbb.services.client import BigBlueButtonClient

# Initialize the client
bbb_client = BigBlueButtonClient(
    "https://your-bbb-server.com/bigbluebutton/api/",
    "your-security-salt",
)

# Check connection
connection_status = bbb_client.check_connection()
print(f"Connection Status: {connection_status}")
```

### Creating a Meeting

1. **Import the necessary modules**:
    ```python
    from sage_bbb.services.client import BigBlueButtonClient

        "your-security-salt",
    )
    ```

3. **Check the connection**:
    ```python
    connection_status = bbb_client.check_connection()
    print(f"Connection Status: {connection_status}")
    ```

4. **Create a new meeting**:
    ```python
    new_meeting = bbb_client.meetings.create_meeting(
        name="Test Meeting",
        meeting_id="random-9887584",
        attendee_pw="ap",
        moderator_pw="mp",
